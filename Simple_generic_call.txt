This note shows a simple way to call any REST service using jQuery.
Make a call, send a JSON object, read a JSON object received, all is right down here.

[code]
  var jsonRequest = { id: 1, name: 'Khtry' };
  $.ajax({
	  url: '{url}',
	  type: 'GET/POST/PUT/...',
	  dataType: 'json',
	  data: jsonRequest,
	  //Looking for a Basic Authentication? Its commented in the next three lines
	  //headers: {
	  //     "Authorization": "Basic " + btoa("{user}" + ":" + "{pass}")
	  //},
	  success: function (data) { 
		   //data is your JSON response
	  }
  });
[/code]
